title: Reinforcement learning with value advice
abstract: The problem we consider in this paper is reinforcement learning with value
  advice. In this setting, the agent is given limited access to an oracle that can
  tell it the expected return (value) of any state-action pair with respect to the
  optimal policy. The agent must use this value to learn an explicit policy that performs
  well in the environment. We provide an algorithm called RLAdvice, based on the imitation
  learning algorithm DAgger. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method in the
  Arcade Learning Environment on three different games, using value estimates from
  UCT as advice.
