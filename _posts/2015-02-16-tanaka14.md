title: Theoretical Analyses on Ensemble and Multiple Kernel Regressors
abstract: For the last few decades, a combination of different learning machines so-called
  ensemble learning, including learning with multiple kernels, has attracted much
  attention in the field of machine learning. Although its efficacy was revealed numerically
  in many works, its theoretical grounds are not investigated sufficiently. In this
  paper, we discuss regression problems with a class of kernels whose corresponding
  reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have a common subspace with an invariant metric
  and prove that the ensemble kernel regressor (the mean of kernel regressors with
  those kernels) gives a better learning result than the multiple kernel regressor
  (the kernel regressor with the sum of those kernels) in terms of the generalization
  ability of a model space.
