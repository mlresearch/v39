title: Dual online inference for latent {D}irichlet allocation
abstract: 'Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) provides an efficient tool to analyze
  very large text collections. In this paper, we discuss three novel contributions:
  (1) a proof for the tractability of the MAP estimation of topic mixtures under certain
  conditions that might fit well with practices, even though the problem is known
  to be intractable in the worst case; (2) a provably fast algorithm (OFW) for inferring
  topic mixtures; (3) a dual online algorithm (DOLDA) for learning LDA at a large
  scale. We show that OFW converges to some local optima, but under certain conditions
  it can converge to global optima. The discussion of OFW is very general and hence
  can be readily employed to accelerate the MAP estimation in a wide class of probabilistic
  models. From extensive experiments we find that DOLDA can achieve significantly
  better predictive performance and more interpretable topics, with lower runtime,
  than stochastic variational inference. Further, DOLDA enables us to easily analyze
  text streams or millions of documents.'
