title: Online matrix prediction for sparse loss matrices
abstract: We consider an online matrix prediction problem. The FTRL is a famous method
  to deal with online prediction task, which makes prediction by minimizing cumulative
  loss function and regularizer function. There are three popular regularizer functions
  for matrices, Frobenius norm, quantum relative entropy and log-determinant. We propose
  a FTRL based algorithm with log-determinant as regularizer and show regret bound
  of algorithm. Our main contribution is to show that log-determinant regularization
  is efficient when sparse loss function setting. We also show the optimal performance
  algorithm for online collaborative filtering problem with log-determinant regularization.
