title: Variational Gaussian Inference for Bilinear Models of Count Data
abstract: Bilinear models of count data with Poisson distribution are popular in applications
  such as matrix factorization for recommendation systems, modeling of receptive fields
  of sensory neurons, and modeling of neural-spike trains. Bayesian inference in such
  models remains challenging due to the product term of two Gaussian random vectors.
  In this paper, we propose new algorithms for such models based on variational Gaussian
  (VG) inference. We make two contributions. First, we show that the VG lower bound
  for these models, previously known to be intractable, is available in closed form
  under certain non-trivial constraints on the form of the posterior. Second, we show
  that the lower bound is bi- concave and can be efficiently optimized for mean-field
  approximations. We also show that bi-concavity generalizes to the larger family
  of log-concave likelihoods that subsume the Poisson distribution. We present new
  inference algorithms based on these results and demonstrate better performance on
  real-world problems at the cost of a modest increase in computation. Our contributions
  in this paper, therefore, provide more choices for Bayesian inference in terms of
  a speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff.
