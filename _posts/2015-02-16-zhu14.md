title: Learning with Augmented Multi-Instance View
abstract: In this paper, we propose the Augmented Multi-Instance View (AMIV) framework
  to construct a better model by exploiting augmented information. For example, abstract
  screening tasks may be difficult because only abstract information is available,
  whereas the performance can be improved when the abstracts of references listed
  in the document can be exploited as augmented information. If each abstract is represented
  as an instance (i.e., a feature vector) x, then with the augmented information,
  it can be represented as an instance-bag pair (x;B), where B is a bag of instances
  (i.e., the abstracts of references). Note that if x has a label y, then we assume
  that there must exist at least one instance in the bag B having the label y. We
  regard x and B as two views, i.e., a single-instance view augmented with a multi-instance
  view, and propose the AMIV-lss approach by establishing a latent semantic subspace
  between the two views. The AMIV framework can be applied when the augmented information
  is presented as multi-instance bags and to the best of our knowledge, such a learning
  with augmented multi-instance view problem has not been touched before. Experimental
  results on twelve TechPaper datasets, five PubMed data sets and a WebPage data set
  validate the effectiveness of our AMIV-lss approach.
