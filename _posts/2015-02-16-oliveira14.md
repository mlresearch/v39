title: Ensembles for Time Series Forecasting
abstract: This paper describes a new type of ensembles that aims at improving the
  predictive performance of these approaches in time series forecasting. Ensembles
  are recognised as one of the most successful approaches to prediction tasks. Previous
  theoretical studies of ensembles have shown that one of the key reasons for this
  performance is diversity among ensemble members. Several methods exist to generate
  diversity. The key idea of the work we are presenting here is to propose a new form
  of diversity generation that explores some specific properties of time series prediction
  tasks. Our hypothesis is that the resulting ensemble members will be better at addressing
  different dynamic regimes of time series data. Our large set of experiments confirms
  that the methods we have explored for generating diversity are able to improve the
  performance of the equivalent ensembles with standard diversity generation procedures.
