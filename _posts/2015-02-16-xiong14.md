title: 'Towards Maximum Likelihood: Learning Undirected Graphical Models using Persistent
  Sequential Monte Carlo'
abstract: Along with the emergence of algorithms such as persistent contrastive divergence
  (PCD), tempered transition and parallel tempering, the past decade has witnessed
  a revival of learning undirected graphical models (UGMs) with sampling-based approximations.
  In this paper, based upon the analogy between Robbins-Monroâ€™s stochastic approximation
  procedure and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), we analyze the strengths and limitations
  of state-of-the-art learning algorithms from an SMC point of view. Moreover, we
  apply the rationale further in sampling at each iteration, and propose to learn
  UGMs using persistent sequential Monte Carlo (PSMC). The whole learning procedure
  is based on the samples from a long, persistent sequence of distributions which
  are actively constructed. Compared to the above-mentioned algorithms, one critical
  strength of PSMC- based learning is that it can explore the sampling space more
  effectively. In particular, it is robust when learning rates are large or model
  distributions are high-dimensional and thus multi-modal, which often causes other
  algorithms to deteriorate. We tested PSMC learning, also with other related methods,
  on carefully-designed experiments with both synthetic and real-word data, and our
  empirical results demonstrate that PSMC compares favorably with the state of the
  art.
