title: Online Passive Aggressive Active Learning and Its Applications
abstract: We investigate online active learning techniques for classification tasks
  in data stream mining applications. Unlike traditional learning approaches (either
  batch or online learning) that often require to request class label of each incoming
  instance, online active learning queries only a subset of informative incoming instances
  to update the classification model, which aims to maximize the classification performance
  using the minimal human labeling effort during the entire online stream data mining
  tasks. In this paper, we present a new family of algorithms for online active learning
  called Passive-Aggressive Active (PAA) learning algorithms by adapting the popular
  Passive-Aggressive algorithms in an online active learning setting. Unlike the conventional
  Perceptron-based approach that employs only the misclassified instances for updating
  the model, the proposed PAA learning algorithms not only use the misclassified instances
  to update the classifier, but also exploit those correctly classified examples yet
  with low prediction confidence. We theoretically analyze the mistakes bounds of
  the proposed algorithms and conduct extensive experiments to examine their empirical
  performance, in which the encouraging results show clear advantages of our algorithms
  over the baselines.
