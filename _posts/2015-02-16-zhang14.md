title: Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction of Data by Deep Distributed Random Samplings
abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental problem of machine learning, and
  has been intensively studied, where classification and clustering are two special
  cases of dimensionality reduction that reduce high-dimensional data to discrete
  points. Here we describe a simple multilayer network for dimensionality reduction
  that each layer of the network is a group of mutually independent k-centers clusterings.
  We find that the network can be trained successfully layer-by-layer by simply assigning
  the centers of each clustering by randomly sampled data points from the input. Our
  results show that the described simple method outperformed 7 well-known dimensionality
  reduction methods on both very small-scale biomedical data and large-scale image
  and document data, with less training time than multilayer neural networks on large-scale
  data.
