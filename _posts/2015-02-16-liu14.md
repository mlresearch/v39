title: Ordinal Random Fields for Recommender Systems
abstract: Recommender Systems heavily rely on numerical preferences, whereas the importance
  of ordinal preferences has only been recognised in recent works of Ordinal Matrix
  Factorisation (OMF). Although the OMF can effectively exploit ordinal properties,
  it captures only the higher-order interactions among users and items, without considering
  the localised interactions properly. This paper employs Markov Random Fields (MRF)
  to investigate the localised interactions, and proposes a unified model called Ordinal
  Random Fields (ORF) to take advantages of both the representational power of the
  MRF and the ease of modelling ordinal preferences by the OMF. Experimental result
  on public datasets demonstrates that the proposed ORF model can capture both types
  of interactions, resulting in improved recommendation accuracy.
