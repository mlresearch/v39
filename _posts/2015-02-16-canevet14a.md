title: Efficient Sample Mining for Object Detection
abstract: 'Object detectors based on the sliding window technique are usually trained
  in two successive steps: first, an initial classifier is trained on a population
  of positive samples (i.e. images of the object to detect) and negative samples randomly
  extracted from scenes which do not contain the object to detect. Then, the scenes
  are scanned with that initial classifier to enrich the initial set with negative
  samples incorrectly classified as positive. This bootstrapping process provides
  the learning algorithm with "hard" samples, which help to improve the decision boundary.
  Little work has been done on how to efficiently enrich the training set. While the
  standard bootstrapping approach densely visits the scenes, we propose to evaluate
  which regions of scenes can be discarded without any further computation to concentrate
  the search on promising areas. We apply our method to two standard object detection
  settings, pedestrian and face detection, and show that it provides a multi-fold
  speed up.'
