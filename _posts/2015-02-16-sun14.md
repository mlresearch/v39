title: Sparsity on Statistical Simplexes and Diversity in Social Ranking
abstract: Sparsity in \Re^m has been widely explored in machine learning. We study
  sparsity on a statistical simplex consisting of all categorical distributions. This
  is different from the case in \Re^m because such a simplex is a Riemannian manifold,
  a curved space. A learner with sparse constraints should be likely to fall to its
  low-dimensional boundaries. We present a novel analysis on the statistical simplex
  as a manifold with boundary. The main contribution is an explicit view of the learning
  dynamics in between high-dimensional models in the interior of the simplex and low-dimensional
  models on its boundaries. We prove the differentiability of the cost function, the
  natural gradient with respect to the Riemannian structure, and convexity around
  the singular regions. We uncover an interesting relationship with L_1 regularization.
  We apply the proposed technique to social network analysis. Given a directed graph,
  the task is to rank a subset of influencer nodes. Here, sparsity means that the
  top-ranked nodes should present diversity in the sense of minimizing influence overlap.
  We present a ranking algorithm based on the natural gradient. It can scale up to
  graph datasets with millions of nodes. On real large networks, the top-ranked nodes
  are the most informative among several commonly-used techniques.
