title: A UCB-Like Strategy of Collaborative Filtering
abstract: 'We consider a direct mail problem in which a system repeats the following
  process every day during some period: select a set of user-item pairs (u,i), send
  a recommendation mail of item i to user u for each selected pair (u,i), and receive
  a response from each user. We assume that each response can be obtained before the
  next process and through the response, the system can know the user’s evaluation
  of the recommended item directly or indirectly. Each pair (u,i) can be selected
  at most once during the period. If the total number of selections is very small
  compared to the number of entries in the whole user-item matrix, what selection
  strategy should be used to maximize the total sum of users’ evaluations during the
  period? We consider a UCB-like strategy for this problem, and show two methods using
  the strategy. The effectiveness of our methods are demonstrated by experiments using
  synthetic and real datasets.'
