title: Reduction from Cost-Sensitive Multiclass Classification to One-versus-One Binary
  Classification
abstract: Many real-world applications require varying costs for different types of
  mis-classification errors. Such a cost-sensitive classification setup can be very
  different from the regular classification one, especially in the multiclass case.
  Thus, traditional meta-algorithms for regular multiclass classification, such as
  the popular one-versus-one approach, may not always work well under the cost-sensitive
  classification setup. In this paper, we extend the one-versus-one approach to the
  field of cost-sensitive classification. The extension is derived using a rigorous
  mathematical tool called the cost-transformation technique, and takes the original
  one-versus-one as a special case. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  approach can achieve better performance in many cost-sensitive classification scenarios
  when compared with the original one-versus-one as well as existing cost-sensitive
  classification algorithms.
