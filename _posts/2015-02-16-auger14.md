title: Sparse binary zero-sum games
abstract: Solving zero-sum matrix games is polynomial, because it boils down to linear
  programming. The approximate solving is sublinear by randomized algorithms on machines
  with random access memory. Algorithms working separately and independently on columns
  and rows have been proposed, with the same performance; these versions are compliant
  with matrix games with stochastic reward. [1] has proposed a new version, empirically
  performing better on sparse problems, i.e. cases in which the Nash equilibrium has
  small support. In this paper, we propose a variant, similar to their work, also
  dedicated to sparse problems, with provably better bounds than existing methods.
  We then experiment the method on a card game.
