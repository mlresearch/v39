title: Interval Insensitive Loss for Ordinal Classification
abstract: We address a problem of learning ordinal classifier from partially annotated
  examples. We introduce an interval-insensitive loss function to measure discrepancy
  between predictions of an ordinal classifier and a partial annotation provided in
  the form of intervals of admissible labels. The proposed interval-insensitive loss
  is an instance of loss functions previously used for learning of different classification
  models from partially annotated examples. We propose several convex surrogates of
  the interval-insensitive loss which can be efficiently optimized by existing solvers.
  Experiments on standard benchmarks and a real-life application show that learning
  ordinal classifiers from partially annotated examples is competitive to the so-far
  used methods learning from the complete annotation.
