title: Bibliographic Analysis with the Citation Network Topic Model
abstract: Bibliographic analysis considers authorâ€™s research areas, the citation network
  and paper content among other things. In this paper, we combine these three in a
  topic model that produces a bibliographic model of authors, topics and documents
  using a non-parametric extension of a combination of the Poisson mixed-topic link
  model and the author-topic model. We propose a novel and efficient inference algorithm
  for the model to explore subsets of research publications from CiteSeerX. Our model
  demonstrates improved performance in both model fitting and clustering task comparing
  to several baselines.
