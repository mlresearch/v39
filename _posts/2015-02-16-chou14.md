title: Pseudo-reward Algorithms for Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoff Functions
abstract: We study the contextual bandit problem with linear payoff functions, which
  is a generalization of the traditional multi-armed bandit problem. In the contextual
  bandit problem, the learner needs to iteratively select an action based on an observed
  context, and receives a linear score on only the selected action as the reward feedback.
  Motivated by the observation that better performance is achievable if the other
  rewards on the non-selected actions can also be revealed to the learner, we propose
  a new framework that feeds the learner with pseudo-rewards, which are estimates
  of the rewards on the non-selected actions. We argue that the pseudo-rewards should
  better contain over-estimates of the true rewards, and propose a forgetting mechanism
  to decrease the negative influence of the over-estimation in the long run. Then,
  we couple the two key ideas above with the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB)
  algorithm to design a novel algorithm called linear pseudo-reward upper confidence
  bound (LinPRUCB). We prove that LinPRUCB shares the same order of regret bound to
  LinUCB, while enjoying the practical observation of faster reward-gathering in the
  earlier iterations. Experiments on artificial and real-world data sets justify that
  LinPRUCB is competitive to and sometimes even better than LinUCB. Furthermore, we
  couple LinPRUCB with a special parameter to formalize a new algorithm that yields
  faster computation in updating the internal models while keeping the promising practical
  performance. The two properties match the real-world needs of the contextual bandit
  problem and make the new algorithm a favorable choice in practice.
